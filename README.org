* =pinentry-emacs=

Put it somewhere, make it executable, tell =gpg= to use it as the
pinentry program.

One way to do this is adding the line
: pinentry-program /path/to/where/you/put/pinentry-emacs
to the file =~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf=.

Make sure you restart gpg-agent and GPG_AGENT_INFO is set correctly
inside Emacs!

If your Emacs hangs, you might have to =C-g=, then you'll get asked,
then you may have to restart the action. Your passphrase will be
cached for some time.
** Emacs
Add this to =.emacs.d/init.el= or similar:

:(defun pinentry-emacs (desc prompt ok error)
:  (let ((str (read-passwd (concat (replace-regexp-in-string "%22" "\"" (replace-regexp-in-string "%0A" "\n" desc)) prompt ": "))))
:    str)) 

This is probably totally insecure, and your passphrase may be leaked!
